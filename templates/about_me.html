                  Hello! My name is Christian Boland Ross, and I am a passionate creator and tech enthusiast.
                  With a background in technology and multimedia, I focus on exploring the intersection of creativity and coding.
                  Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in CGI, video production, and digital design.
                  I am always looking for new ways to express myself and share my ideas with the world,
                  whether it's through creating engaging content or building websites. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333;">
                VFX has been a strong passion of mine for a while now, and I have been a hobbyist / part time
                freelancer since 2023. My previous experience consists of freelancing both as a sole
                trader and as part of the Visionary VFX studio (visionaryvfx.org) for the past year. Freelancing
                individually helped me to understand the importance of communication with the client and
                how to properly represent their intended vision in the work, but more importantly freelancing
                as part of a studio really helped me to understand how to function as part of a larger team of
                artists. From story conception and pre-visualisation, to understanding how to properly interface
                footage and information between different segments in a pipeline, working as part of Visionary
                was one of the most enjoyable opportunities I have had the pleasure of realising.
                <br><br>
                I got in contact with the Owner, my good friend Joel Calorte, and he gave me this reference:

                “
                <br>
                    Chris is an exceptional professional, consistently approaching every project
                    with dedication and a commitment to excellence. He reliably meets deadlines
                    and delivers work on time, ensuring every project receives his best effort.
                    Beyond his technical skills, Chris is a humble and kind individual, known for
                    his collaborative spirit. His 3D work, in particular, stands out for its outstanding
                    quality and creativity, making him a valuable asset to any team.
                    Best Regards, Joel Calorte
                    Owner of Visionary Studios
                <br>

                As Visionary is a slightly smaller studio the artists tend to wear more hats, and I frequently
                worked in every stage of the pipeline from pre-visualisation to colour grading, but I tend to
                specialise closer to the role of a 3D Generalist, and I think my showreel reflects this. In terms
                of software, I am most comfortable with Blender for 3D and Davinci Resolve for editing, with its
                Fusion page for compositing. However, I also have basic knowledge in a variety of programs,
                such as Adobe After effects, Houdini, Nuke, Substance Painter 3D, and Unreal engine.
